# DnD-Ability-Score-Equalizer
A simple program to roll 5 stats for D&D/d20 and use point-buy rules to assign the 6th stat, making for better balanced and more fun character generation.
### The Paradox
You are a DM for D&D, and you want your players to roll dice for their starting ability scores for their characters. Rolling dice ensures that every character is unique. **However,** you don't want a few very bad (or very good) rolls ruin the fun. Your players are still feuding over your last campaign, where the fighter's highest ability score was less than the sorcerer's lowest.
### The Solution
You don't have to compromise if they roll dice for 5 out of the 6 scores, and then use the optional point-buy rules for their 6th score.
### The DnD Ability Score Equalizer
This handy little program lets you enter 5 rolled ability scores (or even auto-roll them with digital dice), set a point-buy budget (27 is default, I personally use 28), and then the DnD Ability Score Equalizer will automatically do the math and assign you a point-buy balanced 6th stat. Now you can reward your player who rolled crap with a bonus 18 and make their day (or hand a kryptonite 3 to the dude who just rolled double 17s).
### From One Game Master to Another
I have used this system for many years in several d20-based games and my players have always loved it. Those who roll poorly get to be the "really good at one thing" character while those who roll really well enjoy roleplaying the near-fatal flaw handed to them by the calculator.
